- Change sfind: for(size_t i = 0; i < hayStack.len - needle.len; ++i) maybe?
- Maybe free and close things on elog, maybe on quit
- Make args global
- Make error a global settable variable, make functions return bool to indicate failure
- Make file_read set the error.info[0] or file_path at the beginning so on ERROR_MALLOC we get info about the file also
